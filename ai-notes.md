## Purpose

This file documents how ChatGPT, a generative AI was used to assist in developing and organizing the *Golf Scorekeeping* project. It provides transparency about which parts were AI-assisted and which were authored manually.

---

## Areas Where ChatGPT Assisted

* **Repository Setup:** Guidance on creating the `/src`, `/README.md`, and `/ai-notes.md` files.
* **README Drafting:** Generated a professional template including *Overview & Features*, *How to Run Locally*, *Known Issues*, and *Future Work*.
* **Project Organization:** Recommended folder structure and Git commands to push the project to GitHub.
* **Documentation Support:** Suggested consistent Markdown formatting and standard repository documentation practices.

## Human Contributions

* Implemented and tested the actual scorekeeping logic and UI.
* At first, the game was not allowing me to change the number of players, and the title had a typo, so I reutilized the AI to create an improved version of it. 
* Adjusted the design, wording, and feature list to reflect the current version of the game.
* Verified that the AI-generated structure matched the project’s needs and made manual edits where necessary.
* Designed and enabled the **Safe Mode** feature to ensure stable and error-free gameplay for testing or limited environments.

## AI Ethical Use Statement

AI was used as a **development assistant** — not as an autonomous code generator.
All code and documentation were **reviewed, tested, and approved** by myself before inclusion in this repository.

## Future AI Use

* Explore AI code review suggestions to improve efficiency and readability.
* Generate automated test cases for score validation and input handling.
* Assist in expanding the README and producing a short user guide for non-technical players.
